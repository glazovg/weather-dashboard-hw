# Weather Dashboard Application
This application is going to provide weather information to the user depending on their search.

Searcher is going to give options for autocomplete based only on US cities, but the user is going to be able to search for any city of their preference.

Every time a search is done, if the city is not in the History section, the city is going to be added to History as a button.

Every time the user clicks on a history button, the weather information is going to be shown.

Max history is 8 cities and if there is a new search the oldest history city is going to be replace for the last one (last city search).
